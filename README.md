# Releases

### GitHub
This is where [stable builds](https://github.com/HyperBE32/Marathon/releases) of Marathon are published; if you're looking for the most reliable experience.

### AppVeyor
While it can be fun to live on the bleeding edge; [AppVeyor builds](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/HyperBE32/Marathon) are published for each new commit, so changes can be unstable.
